Repulsive, horrifying notion), alcohol units 4 (excellent), cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow), number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)...""

Bridget Jones' Diary is the devastatingly self-aware, laugh-out-loud daily chronicle of Bridget's permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement — a year in which she resolves to: reduce the circumference of each thigh by 1.5 inches, visit the gym three times a week not just to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult--and learn to program the VCR.

Over the course of the year, Bridget loses a total of 72 pounds but gains a total of 74. She remains, however, optimistic.

The physical evidence might confirm suicide, but there is no doubt that it strongly suggests murder. The police investigation quickly uncovers a maze of emotion and conflict that surrounded the dead man in the last months of his life: an estranged wife, Terri Peralta; an ugly custody fight over their six-year-old daughter, Elena; threats of extortion; accusations of adultery; and sexual abuse of the child. And then the police uncover a murder suspect. He's Terri's new lover, Christopher Paget, a man of wealth and prominence, an extremely high-profile San Francisco defense attorney. Paget has motive - it's his son accused of abusing Elena, his personal and political plans for the future put at risk by the dead man's accusations - and his alibi is dangerously threadbare.\n\nNow, defense attorney becomes defendant. Now Paget's defense attorney, Caroline Masters - an equally high-powered lawyer and former judge - works desperately to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury, even as Paget and Terri struggle to preserve their future and that of their cherished children. But as the trial progresses, we begin to see that what comes to light in the courtroom may be fatefully intertwined with what threatens to remain hidden: by Paget's refusal to testify on his own behalf, by Elena's tangled loyalties, and by Terri's inability - or unwillingness - to recall the details of her own childhood trauma.""}",[6499458],"{'type': '/type/datetime', 'value': '2011-08-12T00:34:07.622733'}",5,/books/OL24206622M,[{'key': '/authors/OL23801A'}],eyesofchild00patt,['New York'],[{'key': '/languages/eng'}],565 p. ;,,['ia:eyesofchild00patt'],,565.0,['9780345386137'],"{'type': '/type/datetime', 'value': '2010-05-05T08:14:46.192184'}",,1996,['33891325'],[{'key': '/works/OL15139168W'}],{'key': '/type/edition'},5,['IA104523'],nyu,Richard North Patterson,,"['Trials (Murder) -- California -- San Francisco -- Fiction.', 'Child sexual abuse -- California -- San Francisco -- Fiction.', 'Lawyers -- California -- San Francisco -- Fiction.', 'Juicios criminales -- California -- San Francisco -- Novela.', 'Abuso sexual de niños -- California -- San Francisco -- Novela.', 'Abogados -- California -- San Francisco -- Novela.', 'San Francisco (Calif.) -- Fiction.', 'San Francisco (Calif.) -- Novela.']",0345386132,0345386132,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0345386132.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg,Eyes of a Child

22,25,Hearts in Atlantis,['Pocket Books'],{'goodreads': ['1033784']},"Although it is difficult to believe, the Sixties are not fictional:
THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

No matter the format, Stephen King's work is spellbinding because the author himself is spellbound. The first hugely popular writer of the TV generation, King published his first novel, Carrie, in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam. Images from that war -- and protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for nearly ten years. In Hearts in Altantis, King mesmerizes readers with fiction deeply rooted in the Sixties, and explores -- through four defining decades -- the haunting legacy of the Vietnam War.

As the characters in Hearts in Atlantis are tested in every way, King probes and unlocks the secrets of his generation for us all. Full of danger, full of suspense, and most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been able to leave completely.

But when she wanders off by herself, and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.

As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to with stand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio's reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her--protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods...

Subsequent printings introduced further departures from the author's words. This edition, based on the Cambridge critical text, restores all the language of Fitzgerald's masterpiece.

Wuthering Heights is the only novel of Emily Brontë, who died a year after its publication at the age of thirty. A brooding Yorkshire tale of love that is stronger than death, it is also a fierce vision of metaphysical passion, in which heaven and hell, nature and society, and dynamic and passive forces are powerfully juxtaposed. Unique, mystical, with a timeless appeal, it has become a classic of English literature.
